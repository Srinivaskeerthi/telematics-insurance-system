# Telematics-Based Usage Insurance System

## Overview

This project implements a usage-based insurance system that analyzes driving behavior data collected via telematics devices. The system uses AI/ML techniques to assess driving risk, adjust insurance premiums accordingly, and provide personalized safety recommendations.

## Features

- **Driving Behavior Analysis:** Processes telematics data (speed, acceleration, braking, cornering) to evaluate driving patterns.
- **Risk Scoring:** Uses machine learning models to score driver risk based on historical and real-time data.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjusts insurance premiums based on calculated risk scores to promote safer driving.
- **Safety Recommendations:** Offers feedback and tips to help drivers improve their driving habits.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separates data collection, behavior analysis, risk assessment, pricing, and feedback into distinct modules.
